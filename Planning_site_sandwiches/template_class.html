					<h1>Brief</h1>
				    <p>This is a Sandwich ordering program with which the user can select from multiple options of different functions. These include printing out the
					sandwich menu with prices, printing out the order menu (the items the user has added to their order), adding an item to their order along with the quantity, editing the order list,
					this editing include the changing of quantity, deleting an item as a whole, or canceling this function incase it was a mistake. More options include, deleting the order list and starting a new order
					and entering the customers details which include a dilivery or pickup option, getting the users name and phone number and the dilivery address if they chose the dilivery option.
					The finial function they can choose is confirming the order - this confirms the order list and the customer details. Finally, there is a quit option incase the user wishes to quit the program. </p>

<h4>Sprint Reveiw - reflection + where to next</h4>
				<p> In Sprint One I had to apply my pressurises learning from the fruit-bowl practice project - creating a menu and
					implement functions. This was a relatively straight forward sprint so not many problems/errors occurred. All I had
					to do was decide what sandwiches I would like on the menu, choose prices, implement the main menu where the user
					could choose to print the menu or quit the program, I had to implement those functions and set out the correct structure
					for the code. The next moves from Sprint One would be creating an order list and adding an item to order list functions -
					these are functions that allow the user to add a sandwich to their order and allows them to view said order. I also
					included some validation points in Sprint One and will develop these further in Sprint Two.

<h4>Sprint Reveiw - reflection + where to next</h4>
				<p>In Sprint Two, as stated in Sprint One reflection, I added an order list and an adding to order list function. Adding
					the order list (order_list = []) was relatively simple, it was the printing of the order list and some parts of the adding
					to order list function that I struggled with.
