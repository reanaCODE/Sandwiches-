					<h1>Brief</h1>
				    <p>This is a Sandwich ordering program with which the user can select from multiple options of different functions. These include printing out the
					sandwich menu with prices, printing out the order menu (the items the user has added to their order), adding an item to their order along with the quantity, editing the order list,
					this editing include the changing of quantity, deleting an item as a whole, or canceling this function incase it was a mistake. More options include, deleting the order list and starting a new order
					and entering the customers details which include a dilivery or pickup option, getting the users name and phone number and the dilivery address if they chose the dilivery option.
					The finial function they can choose is confirming the order - this confirms the order list and the customer details. Finally, there is a quit option incase the user wishes to quit the program. </p>

<h4>Sprint Reveiw - reflection + where to next</h4>
				<p> In Sprint One I had to apply my pressurises learning from the fruit-bowl practice project - creating a menu and
					implement functions. This was a relatively straight forward sprint so not many problems/errors occurred. All I had
					to do was decide what sandwiches I would like on the menu, choose prices, implement the main menu where the user
					could choose to print the menu or quit the program, I had to implement those functions and set out the correct structure
					for the code. The next moves from Sprint One would be creating an order list and adding an item to order list functions -
					these are functions that allow the user to add a sandwich to their order and allows them to view said order. I also
					included some validation points in Sprint One and will develop these further in Sprint Two.

<h4>Sprint Reveiw - reflection + where to next</h4>
				<p>In Sprint Two, as stated in Sprint One reflection, I added an order list and an adding to order list function. Adding
					the order list (order_list = []) was relatively simple, it was the printing of the order list and some parts of the adding
					to order list function that I struggled with. If the user did not have anything in their order list I had to make sure that
					they knew that, which was easy enough. However, when they did have some items in their order list I struggled a little bit with how
					to print it out to them because I used dictionary. After I figured out how to do that, with some research and help from others, the
					next problem I had to tackle was that of figuring out how to multiply the original price of a sandwich by the quantity the user
					wished to add to their order. I figured out, with some help, that I had to create total_amount += item['total_price'] and then
					slightly later in the function, I printed out:  print(f"Total: ${total_amount:.2f}"). Those were the struggles I faced with the
					reveiw_order function. The adding_item to order function was slightly more challenging. I had to implement and get_key function,
					which is different from the get_integer function  - I also included validation throughout Sprint Two - so that the user could easily
					choose the number on the sandwich menu and add it to their order with the quantity. I had to append this to their order list - with
					dictionary, which took some time to figure out. From here I will create a start new order function - this will delet everything that
					the user had added to their order, so they can start again fresh. I will also implement and edit order function. This function
					will allow the user/customer to either edit the quantity of an item in their order list or delete an item as a whole, I will also
					give them the option to go back to main menu incase they made a mistake choosing that option in the main menu, or they changed
					their mind.

<h4>Sprint Reveiw - reflection + where to next</h4>
				<p> In this Sprint I implemented, as stated previously, a start_new_ order function (deletes current order so the user can
					start a new one, and an edit_order function (user can edit quantity of an item in order or delete an item as a whole). I
					first tackled the start_new_order as all I had to do was 'global order_list' and then set said order list back to;
					order_list = []. It was with the edit order function that I struggled quite a bit. First I had to implement a get_index
					function which would allow the user to see the index's of the order list and choose an index which they would like to edit,
					this allowed for fewer errors in the code and a smaller chance that the user would enter the wrong thing. I also included
					validation incase the user entered an integer that was not there or a letter/s. The thing that I had to work out was how to
					structure this function and how to communicate everything clearly to the user incase they entered the wrong thing. Another
					thing that I found difficult was changing the quantity, but form looking at my past codding I figured it out. From here, I am
					going to add a function with which gets the customers details - name, phone number, delivery or pickup, and address.
					I would also have to change the price in reveiw order if they changed the quantity, but I would come to that later on.

<h4>Sprint Reveiw - reflection + where to next</h4>
				<p>In this sprint, Sprint 4, I implemented the get customer details function. This function involved getting the
				   users choice as to weather they would like the order Pickup or Dilivery, getting the users name and phone number
					and if they choose delivery than their address to which the meal would be delivered to. With this, I had to
					create another list so that their information could be stored, I did this using dictionary, which proved to be
					slightly more difficult. I also did validation of the phone number which required some research. At the end of
					this function the program asks the user if the information they had entered was correct - if it was then they
					would return to main menu and if it was not all the info in the list would be deleted. The deletion of the
					info was what I worked more on in sprint 5 as the use of dictionary require more thought to this particular
					action. The next moves from sprint four would be to add a confirm order function and sort out the small
					things. This included if the user had already entered their customer details, adding a $3 dilivery fee, updating the
					total price if the user had edited their order, and deleting the added info in the customer details list.

<h4>Sprint Reveiw - reflection + where to next</h4>
				<p> In Sprint Five, as stated above, I added a confirm order function and tackled the small parts of the code that
					still needed fixing. For the confirmation of order details the program prints out the customer details they have entered
					and their order list (reveiw_order function). The program then asks if this information is correct and if it is not the
					user will be sent back to main menu (nothing will be deleted or changed) and if it is correct, then the program will let
					the user know that once they confirm then they can not go back, from this they can either cancel and be sent back to main menu
					(once again nothing will be deleted or changed) and if they enter (C) than the order will be complete and a new order will start.
					Once they confirm order everything had to be deleted in order-list (which was easy) and in the customer details, which after some
					research nd some help proved to be as follows: customer_details = dict.fromkeys(customer_details, ""). I added this code into
					the places where I needed to reset the customer details list i.e. if the user entered wrong details and wishes to re-enter them.
					After this function was completed I just had to sort out the small parts with some help, they were as stated above (in Sprint 4):
					if the user had already entered their customer details, adding a $3 dilivery fee, updating the total price if the user had edited
					their order, and deleting the added info in the customer details list.
