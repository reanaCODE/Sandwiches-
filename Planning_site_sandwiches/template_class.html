					<h1>Brief</h1>
				    <p>This is a Sandwich ordering program with which the user can select from multiple options of different functions. These include printing out the
					sandwich menu with prices, printing out the order menu (the items the user has added to their order), adding an item to their order along with the quantity, editing the order list,
					this editing include the changing of quantity, deleting an item as a whole, or canceling this function incase it was a mistake. More options include, deleting the order list and starting a new order
					and entering the customers details which include a dilivery or pickup option, getting the users name and phone number and the dilivery address if they chose the dilivery option.
					The finial function they can choose is confirming the order - this confirms the order list and the customer details. Finally, there is a quit option incase the user wishes to quit the program. </p>

<h4>Sprint Reveiw - reflection + where to next</h4>
				<p> In Sprint One I had to apply my pressurises learning from the fruit-bowl practice project - creating a menu and
					implement functions. This was a relatively straight forward sprint so not many problems/errors occurred. All I had
					to do was decide what sandwiches I would like on the menu, choose prices, implement the main menu where the user
					could choose to print the menu or quit the program, I had to implement those functions and set out the correct structure
					for the code. The next moves from Sprint One would be creating an order list and adding an item to order list functions -
					these are functions that allow the user to add a sandwich to their order and allows them to view said order. I also
					included some validation points in Sprint One and will develop these further in Sprint Two.

<h4>Basic test of program: </h4>

<h4>Sprint Reveiw - reflection + where to next</h4>
				<p>In Sprint Two, as stated in Sprint One reflection, I added an order list and an adding to order list function. Adding
					the order list (order_list = []) was relatively simple, it was the printing of the order list and some parts of the adding
					to order list function that I struggled with. If the user did not have anything in their order list I had to make sure that
					they knew that, which was easy enough. However, when they did have some items in their order list I struggled a little bit with how
					to print it out to them because I used dictionary. After I figured out how to do that, with some research and help from others, the
					next problem I had to tackle was that of figuring out how to multiply the original price of a sandwich by the quantity the user
					wished to add to their order. I figured out, with some help, that I had to create total_amount += item['total_price'] and then
					slightly later in the function, I printed out:  print(f"Total: ${total_amount:.2f}"). Those were the struggles I faced with the
					reveiw_order function. The adding_item to order function was slightly more challenging. I had to implement and get_key function,
					which is different from the get_integer function  - I also included validation throughout Sprint Two - so that the user could easily
					choose the number on the sandwich menu and add it to their order with the quantity. I had to append this to their order list - with
					dictionary, which took some time to figure out. From here I will create a start new order function - this will delet everything that
					the user had added to their order, so they can start again fresh. I will also implement and edit order function. This function
					will allow the user/customer to either edit the quantity of an item in their order list or delete an item as a whole, I will also
					give them the option to go back to main menu incase they made a mistake choosing that option in the main menu, or they changed
					their mind.
